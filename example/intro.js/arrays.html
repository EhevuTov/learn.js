<div>
Arrays are similar to objects except that the elements are ordered and
javascript provides many built-in functions for manipulating the elements of the
array.
</div>

<div>
Arrays can be created using array literal syntax:
</div>

<pre>
var xs = [ 3, 4, 5 ]
</pre>

<div>
To see how many elements an array has, use <span class="code">.length</span>:
</div>

<pre>
var values = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]
console.log(values.length)
</pre>

<div>
Arrays can also be modified. When you <span class="code">.push(x)</span>,
<span class="code">x</span> gets put onto the end of the array.
When you <span class="code">.pop()</span>, the element at the end of the array
is removed and its value is returned.
</div>

<pre>
var xs = [ 9, 8 ]
xs.push(11)
console.dir(xs)
var x = xs.pop()
console.log('x = ' + x)
console.dir(xs)
</pre>

<div>
To see what methods array has built into it, you can do:
</div>

<pre>
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Array.prototype)
</pre>
