It's easy to get started using javascript as a calculator.
</div>

<div>
You can type arithmetic mathematical expressions like 2 + 3 * 5.
This is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix notation</a>.
Try some expressions for yourself in the box below!
</div>

<div>
Here are some operators to get you started:
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>symbol</th>
    <th>operation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+</td>
    <td>addition</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>subtraction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>division</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>multiplication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td>
    <td>modulo</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="repl"></div>

<div>
Note that in the expression,
<span class="code">2 + 3 * 5</span>
the result is <span class="code">17</span>
instead of
<span class="code">25</span>.
As you may remember from algebra class,
multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>)
is higher up on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">order of operations</a>
than addition (<span class="code">+</span>).
In programming languages this order of operations is often called
operator precedence.

<div>
This type of interactive, calculator-style environment is called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>
is short for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
The REPL reads your input, evaluates the input you gave it, prints the result of
the evaluation, and then starts all over again reading input.
</div>

<div>
Sometimes storing a result for later is convenient. Use the
<span class="code">var</span> keyword for that.
</div>

<pre>
var x = 3 * 2 + 5
</pre>

<div>
Now whenever you use the <span class="code">x</span> name in an expression, the
value of <span class="code">x</span> will be used!
</div>

<div>
Try this in the REPL:
</div>
