<div>
It's easy to get started using javascript as a calculator.
</div>

<div>
You can type arithmetic mathematical expressions like 2 + 3 * 5.
This is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix notation</a>.
Try some expressions for yourself in the box below!
</div>

<div>
Here are some operators to get you started:
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="first">symbol</th>
    <th class="last">operation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+</td>
    <td>addition</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>subtraction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>division</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>multiplication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td>
    <td>modulo</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="repl"></div>

<div>
Note that in the expression,
<span class="code">2 + 3 * 5</span>
the result is <span class="code">17</span>
instead of
<span class="code">25</span>.
As you may remember from algebra class,
multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>)
is higher up on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">order of operations</a>
than addition (<span class="code">+</span>).
In programming languages this order of operations is often called
operator precedence.
</div>

<div>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence">Read more about operator precedence in javascript</a>.
</div>

<div>
This type of interactive, calculator-style environment is called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>
is short for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
The REPL reads your input, evaluates the input you gave it, prints the result of
the evaluation, and then starts all over again reading input.
</div>

<div>
Sometimes storing a result for later is convenient. Use the
<span class="code">var</span>
keyword and the equal sign
(<span class="code">=</span>) to give a value a name.
</div>

<pre>
var x = 3 * 2 + 5
</pre>

<div>
Now whenever you use the <span class="code">x</span> name in an expression, the
value of <span class="code">x</span> will be used!
You can use whatever names for variables you want, so long as they are all one
word with no spaces and no punctuation except for
<span class="code">_</span> and <span class="code">$</span>.
</div>

<div>
Let's compute the area of a circle!
</div>

<pre>
var pi = 3.14
var r = 5
var area = pi * r * r
</pre>

<div>
If you type these lines onto the REPL, now <span class="code">area</span> will
have the value you wanted. Type <span class="code">area</span> by itself on the
REPL to see its value.
</div>

<div>
We can put all those declarations on the same line by using a semicolon to
separate the statements:
</div>

<pre>
var pi = 3.14; var r = 5; var area = pi * r * r
</pre>

<div>
Javascript has some math routines built into it too! Try these lines in the
REPL:
</div>

<pre>
Math.cos(0)
Math.tan(1 / Math.PI)
Math.sin(Math.acos(0))
</pre>

<div>
These math routines are function calls. More on those later.
</div>

<div>
For some points, use the REPL to compute the following values:
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="first">quantity</th>
    <th>value</th>
    <th></th>
    <th class="last">status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      three times four plus eleven minus three
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="text" class="value">
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="button" id="calc-0" value="check">
    </td>
    <td class="ok">---</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      (((111*5)+44*99/555)+33)*0.5
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="text" class="value">
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="button" id="calc-1" value="check">
    </td>
    <td class="ok">---</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      sin of pi-sixths
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="text" class="value">
    </td>
    <td>
      <input type="button" id="calc-2" value="check">
    </td>
    <td class="ok">---</td>
  </tr>
</table>
