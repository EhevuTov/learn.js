<div>
Sometimes, you might want to have your program behave differently depending on
the result of some expression. Use an <span class="code">if</span> block for
that!
</div>

<pre>
var z = true
if (z) {
    console.log('z is true!')
}
</pre>

<div>
Now change the value of <span class="code">z</span>:
</div>

<pre>
var z = false
if (z) {
    console.log('z is true!')
}
</pre>

<div>
...the message no longer gets printed!
There is another type of block that can follow an <span class="code">if</span>
block that will fire if the <span class="code">if</span> condition fails:
<span class="else">else</span>!
</div>

<pre>
var z = false
if (z) {
    console.log('z is true!')
}
else {
    console.log('z is false!')
}
</pre>

<div>
You can put any single expression into an if's condition.
The value of the expression will be coerced into a boolean the same as wrapping
a call to <span class="code">Boolean()</span>
around the value yourself.
</div>

<div>
You can create boolean expressions to create lots of types of tests.
Here are some operators that perform tests and return a boolean value:
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>operator</th>
    <th>name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;</td>
    <td>less than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;=</td>
    <td>less than or equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;</td>
    <td>greater than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;=</td>
    <td>greater than or equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>==</td>
    <td>is equal (coercive)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!=</td>
    <td>not equal (coercive)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>===</td>
    <td>is equal (strict)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!==</td>
    <td>not equal (strict)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div>
Try modifying this program for all of the different types of boolean test
operators and different values for <span class="code">n</span>:
</div>

<pre>
var n = 3

if (n &lt; 5) {
    console.log('n is less than 5!')
}
</pre>

<div>
You could also assign the result of the test to a variable:
</div>

<pre>
var n = 3
var b = n &lt; 5

if (b) {
    console.log('n is less than 5!')
}
</pre>

<div>
These binary boolean operators will help to string boolean expressions
together:
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>operator</th>
    <th>name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;&amp;</td>
    <td>and</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>||</td>
    <td>or</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div>
Try building some compound statements like these:
</div>

<pre>
var x = 3
var y = 2

if (x &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 1) {
    console.log('true!')
}
else {
    console.log('false!')
}
</pre>

<div>
You can also chain together more conditional statements with
<span class="code">else if</span>:
</div>

<pre>
var n = 4
if (x &lt;= 3) {
  console.log('x is less than or equal to 3!')
}
else if (x === 8) {
  console.log('x is eight!')
}
else {
  console.log('x is something else!')
}
</pre>

<div>
You can put in as many <span class="code">else if</span>s as you like!
</div>

There is another type of boolean operator which is unary like
<span class="code">++</span> that we saw previously. It's the NOT operator and
it's just a <span class="code">!</span>. It returns the opposite boolean value.

<pre>
var b = false
if (!b) {
    console.log('not b is true!')
}
</pre>
