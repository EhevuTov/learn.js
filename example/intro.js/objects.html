<div>
Objects are data types that can hold other pieces of data. In javascript, every
piece of data is actually an object, but usually objects are created using
object literal notation, like this:
</div>

<pre>
var obj = { a : 2, b : 'hooray' }
</pre>

<div>
To pull out an object, you can use the dot (<span class="code">.</span>)
operator with a key name. Try these:
</div>

<pre>
obj.a
obj.b
</pre>

<div>
You can also use square brackets to look up values from an object:
</div>

<pre>
obj['a']
obj["b"]
</pre>

<div>
With square brackets, you can use a variable to hold the key. Try this in the
REPL:
</div>

<pre>
var x = 'b'
obj[x]
</pre>

<div>
If you try to look up a value that doesn't exist, you'll get
<span class="code">undefined</span>.
</div>
