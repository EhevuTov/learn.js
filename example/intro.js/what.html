Programming is a way of getting a machine to do your bidding.
</div>

<div>
Humans are pretty good at understanding what you want them to do, even when you
give them ambiguous commands.
</div>

<div>
Computers are really terrible at figuring out what you mean. To get a computer
to do your bidding, you've got to be very explicit about every step required to
achieve your ends. Typing exactly the right characters matters a lot!
</div>

<div>
Consider the following button:
<input id="what-button" type="button" value="Click me for +5 points!">
</div>

<div>
If you click it once, you get 5 points.
However, if you click the button again, you don't get any points.
</div>

<div>
In programming and computer science, we might say that pressing the button
transitioned the program behind the button from one
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a>
to the next.
In the first state, clicking the button adds 5 points and moves to the next
state. In the next state, clicking the button does nothing.
</div>

<div>
Computer programs can be thought of in terms of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machines</a>
&dash;
a series of transitions and transformations from one state to the next.
